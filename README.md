7. Import ***App.css*** at the top of the ***Greeting.js*** file
8. Create a card that is 400px wide and has a height of 400px. Give it a border and center it on the page(you will need to use css for this)
9. Inside of the card, render an ***h1*** that says ***Hello, AnnieCannons!***
10. Back in ***App.js***, import ***Greeting.js*** at the top of the file
11. Render 3 instances of ***Greeting*** in ***App's*** return statement
12. Refactor both ***Greeting.js*** and ***App.js*** so that there are three Greeting cards rendered, all with the different names passed in. Use the slides, Google, and ask questions for this step.
